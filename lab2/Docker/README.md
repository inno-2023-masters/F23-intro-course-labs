# Docker
## Description
Tool that allows us to develope and deliver software in containers (OS-level virtualization package).
## Purpose and benefits
  * __Scalability__ - many *__Docker__ containers* can be placed and executed in one host that gives us opportunity to expand project adding new modules.
  * __Fast deployment__ - all you need is _Dockerfile_ where you describe needed parameters of container and commands to be executed to successfully run application
  * __Cheap deployment__ - setting up _container_ is much cheaper than renting standart server itself.
## Real-world use cases
Most of the time code that properly runs on one machine, could easily fall on others (due to dependencies, OS, hardware), because of that code 
deployment could become a very complicated task. In that case __Docker__ is a great solution - containerized programme will definitely perform
precisely as it did during the test.
