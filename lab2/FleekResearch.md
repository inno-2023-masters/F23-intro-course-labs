## Fleek deployment steps
  * Connect _Fleek_ and _GitHub_ accounts
  * Choose _GitHub_ directory for deployment
  * Choose deployment location - for now _Fleek_ provides 2 options (IPFS, Mainnet)
  * Setup project - choose branch to deploy, add build parameters (project Framework, Docker image, commands to run code, etc.)

## Observations
Fleek provides fast and easy website development, that is great for pet projects or some open-source, but due to work with public repositories
it's impossible for some big-techs to publish their services here in terms of security.
