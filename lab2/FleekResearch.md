# Fleek.co

## Steps to set up the project on Fleek.
0. go to fleek.co and sign up using your github 
1. select the repo on which we have our source code, so i select my forked repos of all the labs
2. now select the hosting platform, here we select the IPFS (InterPlanetairy File system)
3. Finally we select our main branch and let the default configurations and then deploy our site.

## IPFS link and default domain of the deployed project.
0. IPFS link: https://fleek.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcGd6GAASJaEHtuip4WwiWyaCoowkpVJx5jWfBSTV542g/
1. domain: https://falling-sound-6714.on.fleek.co


## Observartions
- IPFS comes with a built in CDN for blazing fast performance
- It works as a decentralized server system, even when one server is down then it wont effect our site. So it reduces our websites down time.
