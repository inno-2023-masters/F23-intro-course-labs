As I work in Ubuntu there were some difficulties with an installation VM. After errors in VM I made Secure Boot disable and it really helps.
Firstly, I installed VM package from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads and followed instructions in this site. Next, I installed optical 
controller and it was added in VM. Finally, I ran VM, version is 6.1
