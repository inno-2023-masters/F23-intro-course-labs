### Task 1 - VM Deployment
First of all, I installed Oracle VirtualBox for Ubuntu 22.02 (I have a Ubunto based Linux OS Mint). My installed version is `7.0.12 r159484 (Qt5.15.3)`.

In order to create new VM I downloaded the ISO image of an OS and configured the following settings in VM Box:
1. Selected `Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar Lobster)` Linux OS
2. Configured 8192 MB of RAM
3. Configured 4 CPUs
4. Configured 25 GB of hard drive to Virtual Hard Disk

Then I launched the VM (see VM1.png, VM2.png)
