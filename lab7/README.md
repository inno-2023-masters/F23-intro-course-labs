# Virtualization Lab

In this lab, you will learn how to deploy a Virtual Machine (VM) using VirtualBox and customize its settings. Follow the steps below to complete the assignment.

## Task 1: VM Deployment

**To achieve a grade of 6/10**, follow these steps:

1. Install VirtualBox:
   - Download and install VirtualBox from the official website based on your operating system.
   - Provide the version number of VirtualBox in your report.

2. Deploy a Virtual Machine:
   - Create a new Virtual Machine (VM) using VirtualBox and choose the Ubuntu operating system.
   - Customize the VM settings, such as the allocated memory, number of CPU cores, and network configuration.
   - Document the steps you followed to deploy the VM, including any specific configurations you made.
   - Take a screenshot of the VM running and include it in your report.

## Task 2: System Information Tools

To earn an additional 4 points, follow these steps to discover suitable tools for displaying system information:

1. Processor, RAM, and Network Information:
   - Research and discover a suitable command-line tool for displaying processor, RAM, and network information separately.
   - Install the tool on your VM if needed.
   - Use the tool to display the processor, RAM, and network information of the VM but separately, can be the same command with different flags.
   - Document the name of the tool, the command(s) used, and provide the output in a Markdown file named "SystemInfo.md" in the lab folder.

2. Operating System Specifications:
   - Research and discover a suitable command-line tool for displaying the operating system specifications.
   - Install the tool on your VM if needed.
   - Use the tool to display the operating system specifications of the VM.
   - Document the name of the tool, the command(s) used, and provide the output in the same "SystemInfo.md" file.

### Guidelines

- Use proper Markdown formatting and structure for the documentation files.
- Organize the files within the lab folder using appropriate naming conventions.
- Create a Pull Request to the main branch of the repository with your completed lab assignment.

> Note: Actively explore VM deployment using VirtualBox and discover suitable command-line tools for displaying system information to gain insights into hardware specifications and operating system details.
