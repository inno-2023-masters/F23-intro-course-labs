## Task 2: DevOps in Practice

### Scenario and Challenges:

X is a growing startup that develops a web application for managing customer data. The development team consists of developers, testers, and operations personnel. They are facing several challenges in their software development and deployment process:

1. **Manual and error prone deployments:** 

The team currently deploys the application manually, which leads to inconsistencies and errors in the deployment process. This delays deliverables.


2. **Inefficient testing and feedback loops:**

The testing process is time-consuming and relies heavily on manual testing which takes time and resources for new releases.

3. **Inconsistent code and blame game:**

The devs push inconstent codes and may push breaking changes which might not work on others' system. This may result in blame game that devA broke changes while devB would point fingers to others. 


### Solution of challenges via Devops Practices:

1. **CD:**

Implementing CI/CD practices will automate the build, testing, and deployment processes and hence eliminate manually introduced erros and make deployments faster. 

2. **CI/CD:** 

As CI/CD practices will automate the build, testing, the need for manual testing is highly reduced saving time for relase and costs of testing. CI will also ensure that code is consistent across developers and it will not pass build for deployment if someone made an error so it will prevent developeres pushing some breaking changes by accident.
