Every development team should somehow apply DevOps practices in their workflow.  
Let's imagine some small startup dreaming of launching their project as a subscription service.  
In that case, DevOps practices are mandatory, because users pay for their subscription and every fall could be the reason to cancel
their subscription that could lead to decrease in income.  
Some of DevOps practices to be applied and how they possibly could improve app workflow:
  * __Collaboration__ - collaborative work of development and DevOps teams will help to oranize better workflow, where updates will be published as
fast as possible and the process of updating itself will be more resilient.
  * __CI/CD__ - automation of CI/CD process will make it fall tolerant and reliable with with minimal investment of time and effort.
  * __Performance metrics measurement__ - with growth of new users, server load will grow as well, to handle such a load without increase in expenses
(buying/loaning more hardware), the solution could be in optimizing application's code. To do so, it will be helpful to track resource consumption of
separate services or operations (depends on project architecture) to find problem places and optimize them.
