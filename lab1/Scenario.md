## Scenario

Team invents some hardware and needs to test it. The team is very small and does not have enough time to test it. This team has some solutions from DevOps principles and practices:
* Automation
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* Monitoring

### Lack of automation

Our team needs to test their hardware. To do this, the team creates some scripts that check voltage or uptime, for example. 

### Deployment failures

Teams hire new people as testers. This leads to a lot of deployment failures because the new people have no experience and don't know how to deploy the product properly. To solve this problem, teams use the IaC principle. By automating infrastructure setup and configuration, the team can ensure consistency. In addition, the use of containers such as Docker facilitates easy deployment.

### Limited monitoring

The team lacks visibility into application performance and operational metrics. By implementing robust monitoring and logging practices, the team can gain insight into application behaviour and performance.
