# Scenarios

## Frequent Development Issues
The team faces frequent deployment issues due to a lack of coordination and communication between developers and operations personnel.
Developers write code in isolation without considering operational requirements, leading to deployment failures and rollbacks.

### Solution
Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with DevOps. By adopting DevOps principles, the team establishes a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility.
They implement CI/CD pipelines that automate the build, testing, and deployment processes. This ensures that code changes are tested thoroughly and deployed consistently, reducing deployment issues and improving overall software quality.

## Application Performance Issues
The team struggles with identifying and resolving performance issues in the application. They rely on manual monitoring and lack comprehensive visibility into the application's performance in different environments.

### Solution
Introduce Continuous Monitoring Tools that provide real-time insights into application performance, enabling proactive identification and resolution of performance bottlenecks.

## Slow Feedback Loop
The team experiences a slow feedback loop between development, testing, and operations, leading to delays in identifying and resolving issues. Developers receive limited feedback on the performance and stability of their code, which hampers rapid iteration and improvement

### Solution
Implement Continuous Testing and Collaboration. The team embraces the practice of Continuous Testing, where automated tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipelines.
This ensures that code changes are thoroughly tested at every stage. This reduces the feedback loop, enabling faster issue identification and resolution.
