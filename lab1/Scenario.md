# Scenario

Lets say we have to develop a software for a very complex robot for a multi national company. We have a team with excellent software developers, Electrical and Mechatronics Engineers. All the team members should be invited to the meeting with the customers to discuss the requirements. Lets see how the DevOps principles and practices can be used for our scenario.

The team encounters various challenges:
1. **Lack of Collaboration and Visibility (Gap in between Development and Operations teams)**
2. **Lack of Automation for testing, integration, deployment or release**
3. **Gap in Continuous Integration and Continuous delivery (CI/CD)**

Firstly, we start with bridging a gap between the siloed teams, so we can start making a collaboration with the customer and then after they know the requirements of the customers there should be an internal meeting with all the team members including all the development branches (i.e. software, electrical and mechatronics), operations teams. here comes the first practice from the DevOps'es practices which is Agile Planning.

### Agile planning and Collaboration:
By using the agile planning methods the team can overcome the challenges faced in terms of project management,  collaboration, visibility etc.
The following can be adopted into the DevOps culture of the team:

- **Workflow phases:**
Start the daily metting with adding your task to a chart which has do, in-progress, code review, and done heading. And this should be shared to all the team members.
This can be done in the daily scrum meetings as well.

- **Breakdown of large projects:**
The team should brainstorm ideas and breakdown the large scale projects into smaller chunks of tasks and planned before starting the development cycle. This will help in a proper understandign and set each team members responsibilities clear.

- **Meetings and managemnebt**
Daily scrumb meeting before starting the workday will help each of the team members to set thier goals for the day and also clears if any team memeber is having any dependanccy with other team member so that they can coordinate with each other.

By utilizing the agile planning the team can easily change the course of the project by adding new ideas by getting feedback from the recent releases. It can also support the concept of **Continuous Development**



Secondly, the team needs automation tools which can help them
### Continuous Integration and Continuous delivery (CI/CD)
By adopting Continuous Integratoin and Continuous delivery pipeline/tools, the developers can automate the building, testing, integration and deployment of the code very easily. This saves a lot of invaluable time and increases the speeds and quality of the product deployment. Also the developers will be able to test and fix any issues in the early stages
