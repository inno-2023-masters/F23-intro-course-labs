## Scenario:

```
A team of jonior web developers are trying to create and deploy new website.
However, they are having the following problems:
```

### Challenges:

1. Slow and error-prone deployment: inconsistent deployments lead to errors.
2. Late bug detection and low quality.

### How DevOps could contribute:

1. Continuous Integration (CI): Automating code building, testing, and integration as developers commit their code allows for early bug detection, ensuring a stable codebase, and reducing development cycle time.

2. Continuous Delivery (CD): Implementing CD pipelines automates the release and deployment process, enabling consistent and reliable deployments across different environments, reducing errors and streamlining the release process.
