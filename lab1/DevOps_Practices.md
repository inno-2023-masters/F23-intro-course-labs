## Continuous Integration (CI):

```
It refers to the automation of process such as building, testing, and integrating code changes as soon as the developers commit their code into some shared repository.
```

- Use Case: Automating the build and testing process to ensure that code changes integrate smoothly and do not introduce errors.
- Example: A software development team uses a CI tool like Jenkins to automatically build and test their code whenever a commit is made to the shared repository.

## Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):

```
It refers to the automation of the deployment process. Moreover, it involves steps such as testing, and packaging.
```

- Use Case: Automating the deployment process to make it faster, more reliable, and repeatable.

- Example: An e-commerce company uses a CD pipeline with tools like Kubernetes and Docker to automatically package and deploy their application whenever new changes are pushed to the repository.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

```
It refers to the useage of coded configuration files for infastructure instead of manual processes. It makes it easier and faster to edit the config.
```

- Use Case: Managing and provisioning infrastructure resources programmatically to improve efficiency and reduce manual errors.

- Example: A cloud-based startup uses tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to define their infrastructure as code.

## Monitoring:

```
It refers of the continuous observation and measurement of a system's performance. It includes collecting logs and generating alerts to detect the issues of proactively.
```

- Use Case: Keeping track of system performance, availability, and detecting issues in real-time.
- Example: A web hosting company uses monitoring tools like Prometheus or New Relic to collect metrics and logs from their servers.

## Collaboration:

```
It refers to working together as a team to achieve common goals.
```

- Use Case: Facilitating effective communication, coordination, and knowledge sharing among team members.

- Example: A software development team uses collaboration tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to share updates, discuss ideas, and coordinate their work.

## Automation:

```
It refers to the process of reducing manual effort by using tools to perform tasks automatically.
```

- Use Case: Streamlining repetitive tasks and reducing manual effort through the use of tools and scripts.

- Example: A system administrator automates routine server maintenance tasks using a configuration management tool like Ansible.

## Efficiency:

```
It refers to maximizing output while minimizing resource consumption.
```

- Use Case: Optimizing resource utilization and maximizing productivity to achieve more with less.

- Example: A manufacturing company implements lean manufacturing principles and uses process automation tools to eliminate waste, reduce downtime, and improve overall efficiency.
