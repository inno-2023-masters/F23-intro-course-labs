### __DevOps Principles:__
  * _Collaboration_ - the main (imho) principle of DevOps, because without collaborative work of each team, there is no chance to build a system that
could possibly work as one-piece mechanism.
  * _Automation_ - another important principle based on goal to automate development process as much as it possible.
### __DevOps Practices:__
  * _CI/CD_ (combination of continuous __Integration__ and __Deployment__) - this combined principle is that we should automate as many parts
of software development as possible (build, tests, new features/fixes delivery) in order to speed up process and make it secure.
  * _Performance metrics measurement_ - one of the key aspects of project management that helps to identify modules/microservices that could be
imporved in a case of perfrormance time or occupied resource.  

But these practices are based on core DevOps principle
