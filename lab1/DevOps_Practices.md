I have defined core principles and practices of DevOps in few lines

### Core principles are:
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Deployment
* Infrastructure as Code
* Monitoring

### Core practices are: 
* Collaboration
* Automation

## Core principles

**` Continuous integration and deployment `** helps to integrate code changes, perform testing, and deploy software to maintain a development of the app. 

**` Infrastructure as Code `** allows teams to manage and provision infrastructure resources programmatically. It helps in managing configuration of infrastructure, enabling teams to automate infrastructure setup.

**` Monitoring `** can gain insights into system health. By collecting and analyzing relevant data, team increase performance reduce time to solve problems.

## Core practicies
 
**` Collaboration `** between teams, helps in understanding of the software development process. In other words, teams work whith each other, discuss problems and work with higher efficiency by better understanding of project.

By **` automation `** repetitive tasks, such as testing, deployment, and other, teams can free their working time and concentrate on other tasks
