## DevOps Principles & Practices:

1. Continuous Integration (CI): Frequent integration of code changes into a shared repository, allowing teams to catch and address issues early. Example tools: Jenkins, Travis CI.

2. Continuous Delivery (CD): Automating the deployment process to ensure that software can be released at any time. Example tools: CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD.

3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Treating infrastructure configurations as code, enabling automated provisioning and management. Example tools: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation.

4. Configuration Management: Managing and maintaining consistent configurations across environments and infrastructure. Example tools: Ansible, Puppet.

5. Monitoring and Logging: Collecting and analyzing data about system behavior to identify and resolve issues quickly. Example tools: Prometheus, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

6. Microservices: Designing applications as a collection of small, independent services that can be deployed and scaled independently. Example tools: Docker, Kubernetes.

7. Agile and Lean Practices: Emphasizing collaboration, iterative development, and continuous improvement. Example tools: Jira, Trello.

8. Version Control: Managing code changes and facilitating collaboration among development teams. Example tools: Git, GitHub.

9. Automated Testing: Automating the testing process to ensure software quality and reduce manual effort. Example tools: Selenium, JUnit.

10. Collaboration and Communication: Encouraging cross-functional teams to work together effectively. Example tools: Slack, Microsoft Teams.

These are just brief summaries, and each principle and practice has its own nuances and broader concepts to explore.
