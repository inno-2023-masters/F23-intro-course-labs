## Task 1: Research and Define DevOps Principles and Practices
### Definition  of DevOps  
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology.

### Principles
- **Customer-Centric Action**
  - DevOps is a customer-centric action because it focuses on the customer's needs and wants. It
    is important to understand the customer's needs and wants in order to provide them with the
    best possible service.
- **End-To-End Responsibility**
    - DevOps is a process that involves the entire team, from the developers to the operations team.
        This means that everyone is responsible for their own work and they are all accountable for
        the success of the project.
- **Continuous Improvement**
    - DevOps is a process that involves continuous improvement. It is important to constantly
        improve the process in order to make it more efficient and effective.
- **Automation**
    - DevOps is a process that involves automation. It is important to automate as much as possible
        in order to reduce the amount of manual work and increase efficiency.
- **Measurement**
    - DevOps is a process that involves measurement. It is important to measure the performance of
        the process in order to identify areas for improvement.
- **Sharing**
    - DevOps is a process that involves sharing. It is important to share knowledge and information
        in order to improve the process.
- **Lean**
    - DevOps is a process that involves lean. It is important to eliminate waste and reduce
        inefficiencies in order to improve the process.
- **Resilience Engineering**
    - DevOps is a process that involves resilience engineering. It is important to design systems
        that are resilient to failure in order to improve the process.
- **DevOps Culture**
    - DevOps is a process that involves a DevOps culture. It is important to have a culture that
        encourages collaboration and communication in order to improve the process.

### Practices
- **Continuous Integration**
    - Continuous integration is a practice that involves integrating code into a shared repository
        on a regular basis. It is important to integrate code into a shared repository on a regular
        basis in order to reduce the risk of conflicts and errors.
- **Continuous Delivery**
    - Continuous delivery is a practice that involves delivering software to production on a
        regular basis. It is important to deliver software to production on a regular basis in order
        to reduce the risk of errors and bugs.
- **Continuous Deployment**
    - Continuous deployment is a practice that involves deploying software to production on a
        regular basis. It is important to deploy software to production on a regular basis in order
        to reduce the risk of errors and bugs.
- **Infrastructure as Code**
    - Infrastructure as code is a practice that involves managing infrastructure using code. It is
        important to manage infrastructure using code in order to reduce the risk of errors and bugs.
- **Monitoring and Logging**
    - Monitoring and logging is a practice that involves monitoring and logging the performance of
        the system. It is important to monitor and log the performance of the system in order to
        identify areas for improvement.
- **Communication and Collaboration**
    - Communication and collaboration is a practice that involves communicating and collaborating
        with the team. It is important to communicate and collaborate with the team in order to
        improve the process.
- **Microservices**
    - Microservices is a practice that involves breaking down the system into smaller services. It
        is important to break down the system into smaller services in order to reduce the risk of
        errors and bugs.
- **Infrastructure Automation**
    - Infrastructure automation is a practice that involves automating the infrastructure. It is
        important to automate the infrastructure in order to reduce the risk of errors and bugs.
- **Configuration Management**
    - Configuration management is a practice that involves managing the configuration of the system.
        It is important to manage the configuration of the system in order to reduce the risk of
        errors and bugs.
- **Orchestration**
    - Orchestration is a practice that involves orchestrating the deployment of the system. It is
        important to orchestrate the deployment of the system in order to reduce the risk of errors
        and bugs.
- **Continuous Testing**
    - Continuous testing is a practice that involves testing the system on a regular basis. It is
        important to test the system on a regular basis in order to reduce the risk of errors and
        bugs.
- **Continuous Feedback**
    - Continuous feedback is a practice that involves providing feedback on a regular basis. It is
        important to provide feedback on a regular basis in order to improve the process.
- **Continuous Planning**
    - Continuous planning is a practice that involves planning on a regular basis. It is important
        to plan on a regular basis in order to improve the process.
- **Continuous Learning**
    - Continuous learning is a practice that involves learning on a regular basis. It is important
        to learn on a regular basis in order to improve the process.
- **Continuous Experimentation**
    - Continuous experimentation is a practice that involves experimenting on a regular basis. It is
        important to experiment on a regular basis in order to improve the process.
- **Continuous Improvement**
    - Continuous improvement is a practice that involves improving on a regular basis. It is
        important to improve on a regular basis in order to improve the process.
