# DevOps Principles and Practices

## Development loop (lifecycle) automation

One of the main DevOps principles is **automating** tasks that exist
between committing changes to the codebase and seeing the changes in production.

Such as:

- CI/CD
- Monitoring
- Deployment
- Integration
- *Etc.*

This enables companies to be able to *respond to the customer feedback faster*.

## Always seek improvements

DevOps teams should strive for waste minimization.
Whether it's reducing steps for changes to become production ready, or testing,
team should continue to measure performance metric to determine
improvement directions.

## Collabartion and Communication

As DevOps consist of "Dev" and "Ops", good DevOps team should bring
dev and ops together to collabarte with each other. This allows both ends
of the business exceed.

## Being customer-centric

The final customer (user) should be brought into the whole process
at every step. It's impossible to satisfy the users without knowing
what they really need.

It's a tricky process which requires excessive research through various metrics.
