## Definition
DevOps is a set of practices that aim to bridge the gap between software development and operations teams to ensure high quality. 

## Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous Integration is the practice of frequently integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. This simply means that we ensure that any new changes will not break any previous functionality.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)
Continuous Delivery goes hand in hand with CI and focuses on automating the release process. It aims to make the software deployable at any time by ensuring that every change is thoroughly tested and ready for production.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure resources using declarative or programmable templates. It treats infrastructure as software, allowing teams to define and manage infrastructure configurations in a version-controlled manner. 

## Continuous monitoring.
Continuous Monitoring is the practice that involve gathering and analyzing data from production systems to gain insights into their performance and behavior.
