# Lab 01 - Task 1: Research and Define DevOps Principles and Practices: 

Devops is an approach to minimize the time gap between the development process of the product, and the period where the depolyment or testing team is almost idle. For this purpose, the apporach focuses on icluding all the related teams in the process simultaneously.

#### Principles:

According to  ***Atlassian***, the following are considerd as the core principles of DevOps:

- **Collaboration:** High coordination throught the whole process between development and depolyment teams yields into a one functional team, quicker feedbacks and more efficient communication.

- **Automation:** To let the product life cycle be as much automated as possible. THis gives more time for the developers to focus more on development and implementing new features, sometime to fix some bugs. 

- **Continuous Improvement:** allowing team members to continously release updates that bring new features and fix old bugs. This strengthen the product life cycle as well as its value.

- **Customer-centric action:** This enbales the team members to get immediate feedback about how the actual user experiencing the product and allows for quick respond and support.

#### Practices:
A practice in DevOps is realted to real actions more than words and ideas. According to ***Amazon Web Service*** ,  some of practices are: 

- **CI/CD:** Continuous integration is regularly actions where developers push their modifications into the main repository. The aim of this process is to enhance the quality and to fix the bugs more frequently. Continuous Delivery is an extension of CI where the newly introduced modifications into automated environemnt where they are test and diployed for prodcution afte the build phase.

- **Microservices:** is an approach of building an application as a small group of services, where each service has its on purpose and communicates with the other services by certain mechanism.

- **Monitoring and Logging:** this practice moniotrs the impacts of the product infastructure on the end user. it logs how a change or an update influence the experience and analyze the data for further decision making if needed.
