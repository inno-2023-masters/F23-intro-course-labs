# SRE and SLA
## Key Metrics used in SRE and their importance
- Volume: Volume refers to the current number of requests being processed by the system including drops and spikes. It is a good indicator of the current load on the system.
- Availability: Availability is the percentage of time that a system is functional and working. A reliable system has a high availability.
- Latency: Latency refers to the time taken by the system to respond to a request. Low latency is better.
- Errors: Number of requests that failed due to errors. Lower error rate means the system is more reliable. 
- Tickets: Number of issues reported by users. Lower number of tickets means the system is more stable.

## SLA from Two Companies
- Github: Github offers 99.9% uptime for its services. Failing to meet the SLA will let the customer have service credit. Details about uptime calculation and the amount of service credit offered can be found [here](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-online-services-sla).
- Hashicorp: Hashicorp calculates uptime quarterly and offers 99.9% uptime. Failing to meet that will offer users service credits upto 30% (depends on the uptime). Details can be found [here](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sla).
