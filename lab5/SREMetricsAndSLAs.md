# Task 1: Key Metrics for SRE and SLAs
---

### These are the key metrics used in Site Reliability Engineering:
1. Operating time. It measures how much time a service is available. Main goal is to ensure the reliability of the service for the customer.

2. Reaction time. It measures how much time it takes to respond to a customer request. Slow responce time can d lead to reduced level of service and lost revenue and company's reputation.

3. Availability. It measures how good a system is functioning, taking into account other factors, such as planned upgrades and maintenance.

4. Throughput. It measures the amount of data that can be processed in a given period of time. High throughput is important for services that expect high volume of user or data traffic.

5. Error rate. It measures how many errors (bugs, capacity bottlenecks, and other issues) occur when using a service.
