# Site Reliability Engineering

## Key metrics used in SRE

* Error Budget: Defines the acceptable amount of system errors or downtime within a specific time frame.

* Mean Time to Detect (MTTD): Measures the average time taken to detect incidents or issues.

* Mean Time to Recover (MTTR): Measures the average time taken to recover from incidents or issues.

* Service Level Indicators (SLIs): Quantitative measurements of system performance or behavior.

* Service Level Objectives (SLOs): Specific targets for SLIs that must be met to achieve desired reliability.

## Service Level Agreements of two companies

1. Amazon Web Services (AWS): Amazon S3 SLA guarantees 99.9% uptime for customers using their object storage service. 

2. Google Cloud Platform (GCP): GCP offers an SLA for their Compute Engine service, ensuring at least 99.99% availability for virtual machines.

## Discussion 

These metrics and SLAs are crucial for ensuring reliable and performant software systems. SLAs create transparency and trust between service providers and customers
