Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline focused on building and maintaining reliable, scalable, and efficient systems. It employs various metrics to measure system reliability, availability, and performance. Some key metrics commonly used in SRE are:

1. **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**: SLOs define the target level of reliability or performance that a system should achieve over a specific period. They are typically defined in terms of a percentage and represent the acceptable level of service quality. For example, an SLO of 99.9% uptime means the system should be available 99.9% of the time.

2. **Error Budgets**: Error budgets are closely related to SLOs. They represent the acceptable amount of downtime or errors within a specific time frame. By setting an error budget, SRE teams can strike a balance between pushing for new features and maintaining system stability. If the error budget is exhausted, changes that could introduce more risk might be deferred until the next measurement period.

3. **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: MTBF measures the average time between one failure and the next in a system. A higher MTBF indicates higher reliability, as the system can operate for more extended periods without failure.

4. **Mean Time to Recover/Repair (MTTR)**: MTTR measures the average time taken to recover from a failure or repair an issue. Lower MTTR values indicate better system recovery and faster incident resolution.

5. **Error Rates**: Error rates can be measured in various ways, depending on the system's nature. It could be the rate of HTTP 500 errors, database query failures, or any other specific errors that impact the user experience.

6. **Latency and Response Time**: These metrics measure the time it takes for a system to respond to user requests. Lower latency and faster response times contribute to a better user experience and higher system performance.

7. **Availability**: Availability represents the percentage of time a system is operational and accessible. It is often measured in "nines," such as 99.9% (three nines) or 99.999% (five nines).

Now, let's look at two large companies known for their robust systems and try to find their publicly available reliability metrics or SLAs:

1. **Google**:
   Google is renowned for its highly reliable and performant infrastructure. While specific SLOs and SLAs might not always be publicly disclosed for all their services, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services often come with published SLAs. For instance:
    - Google Compute Engine offers a 99.99% SLA for regional uptime.
    - Google Cloud Storage offers a 99.9% SLA for multi-regional and dual-regional storage classes.
    - Google Cloud Pub/Sub offers a 99.99% SLA for availability.

2. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**:
   AWS is another major player in the cloud services domain with a robust infrastructure. AWS provides SLAs for several of its services, ensuring a certain level of availability. Examples include:
    - Amazon EC2 provides a 99.99% uptime SLA for its instances within a region.
    - Amazon S3 offers a 99.99% SLA for the availability of its storage.
