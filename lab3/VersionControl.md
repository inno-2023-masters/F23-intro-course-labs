# Version control

## Definition of version control systems and their purpose

Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that track changes to files and manage different versions of a project over time. Their primary purpose is to facilitate collaboration among multiple users.

## Explanation of the benefits and advantages of using version control in a collaborative environment

* Collaboration: enables multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously, allowing easy merging of changes and resolving conflicts.
* Versioning: keeps a complete history of changes, allowing users to revert to previous versions if needed and track who made which changes.
* Branching and Merging: allows users to create separate branches to work on specific features or experiments, and later merge them back into the main codebase.
* Conflict Resolution: provides mechanisms to handle conflicts that arise when two or more users make conflicting changes to the same file.
* Backup and Recovery: serves as a backup system, ensuring that no work is lost, and offers recovery options in case of accidental deletions or data corruption.

## Overview of different types of version control systems

1. **Centralized:** The central repository stores the entire project's history, and users must connect to it to access files or make changes. Examples: CVS, Subversion (SVN).
2. **Distributed:** Each user has a complete copy of the repository, including the entire history, allowing for offline work and easier collaboration. Examples: Git, Mercurial (Hg).

## Comparison of popular version control systems

- Git: Distributed VCS known for its speed, scalability, and powerful branching and merging capabilities. Widely adopted and supported, used by many large projects and organizations.
- Subversion (SVN): Centralized VCS with a long history. Commonly used in enterprise environments, supports atomic commits and offers good integration with existing tools.
- Mercurial (Hg): Distributed VCS similar to Git, but with a simpler and more intuitive design. Offers ease of use and is popular among Python developers.
