# Operating Systems & Networking Lab

In this lab, you will explore operating systems and networking fundamentals in a DevOps context. You will gain practical experience in working with operating systems and perform network-related tasks. Follow the tasks below to complete the lab assignment.

## Task 1: Operating System Analysis

**To achieve a grade of 6/10**, follow these steps:

1. Analyze Disk Space:
   - Use the appropriate command or tool to check the available disk space on your operating system.
   - Document the command used and provide the output in a Markdown file named "DiskSpaceAnalysis.md" in the lab folder.

2. Inodes Analysis:
   - Use the appropriate command or tool to check the number of inodes on your operating system.
   - Document the command used and provide the output in the same "DiskSpaceAnalysis.md" file.

3. Resource Consumption Analysis:
   - Use the appropriate command or tool to identify the process consuming the most RAM and CPU on your operating system.
   - Document the command used and provide the output in the same "DiskSpaceAnalysis.md" file.
   - Include any observations or insights regarding the resource consumption.

## Task 2: Networking Analysis

To earn an additional 4 points, follow these steps for networking analysis:

1. Traceroute:
   - Use the appropriate command or tool to perform a traceroute to a specified website or IP address.
   - Document the command used and provide the output in a Markdown file named "TracerouteAnalysis.md" in the lab folder.
   - Include any observations or insights regarding the network path and latency.

2. Dig:
   - Use the appropriate command or tool to perform a DNS lookup for a specified domain name.
   - Document the command used and provide the output in the same "TracerouteAnalysis.md" file.
   - Include any observations or insights regarding the DNS resolution.

### Guidelines

- Use proper Markdown formatting and structure for the documentation files.
- Organize the files within the lab folder using appropriate naming conventions.
- Create a Pull Request to the main branch of the repository with your completed lab assignment.

> Note: Actively explore operating system analysis techniques and network analysis tools to gain insights into system resources and network connectivity.
