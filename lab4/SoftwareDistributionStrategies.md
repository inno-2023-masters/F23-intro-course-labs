# Software distribution strategies
## _Software distribution_ definition and significance
__Software distribution__ is a process of delivering a product from developer to the end user.
It is requiered to be consistent, fast and secure in order to keep workflow and user expirience at a decent level.
## _Software distribution_ strategies
  * _Physical media distribution_ - the least flexible option, because software delivered in this way could not be changed after
being recorded and sent via CD, DVD, etc..
  * __Online downloads__ - updatable option, but commonly assumes redownloading app as for the first time
  * __App stores__ - minor improvement comparing to downloading through websites is that new packets being installed in a more effective way that do not include downloading full new version of app.
  * __Package managers__ - great solution for console apps, because can exist without UI and helps to download products in current environment with required dependencies.
  * __Containers__ - revolutionary solution that that allows us to create product inside isolated virtualized area (_container_), so we can run our container on any device with any OS and hardware that is able
to run out containerization tool (e.g Docker)
## Best practices
 * __Version control__ - for tracking project evolution and legacy and having ability to discard changes in case of bugs or crashes appearances.
 * __User feedback and analytics__ - helps to improve UX and perform better and more secure updates later.
 * __Automation and continuous delivery__ - speeds up Software distribution saving people resources and imporving security.
