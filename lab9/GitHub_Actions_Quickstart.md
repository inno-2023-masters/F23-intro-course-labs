# GitHub Actions Quickstart Guide

## Task 1: Create your First GitHub Actions Pipeline

### Reading Official Guide:

#### Steps Followed:

1. Created `.github/workflows` directory in the repository as instructed.
2. Then created a `github-actions-demo.yml` file as per instructions.
3. Added the configuration to the YAML file from the quickstart guide.
4. Committed the workflow file to the new branch, which triggered the GitHub Actions workflow automatically
5. Observed CI status and logs on *Actions* page. 

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Workflow:** A workflow is the basic block that is defined by YAML file in `.github/workflows` directory. This contains commands that'll be run when the pipeline runs.
2. **Events:**  Specific activities that trigger workflows like `push`, `pull_request`, as we did in our case.
3. **Jobs:** Set of steps that execute on the same runner. By default, jobs run in parallel, but they can be configured to run sequentially.
4. **Steps:** Individual tasks that run commands or actions. A job consists of one or more steps.
5. **Runners:** Servers that have the GitHub Actions runner application installed. They run the jobs in a workflow.

#### Observation:

- As soon i created the `.yaml` file and added into the repo with certain steps, the CI got triggered and ran each step one by one. The logs could be seen there.

### Observing the Workflow Execution:

- Pushed the partial task 1.1 and went again on *Actions* tab to see logs.
- The interesting observation for me is the *job setup* section that shows OS and runner image along with read-only permissions for the repo. I am sure we can customize it and use the OS image of our choice.
- Fortunately, No errors were encountered during the process.

### Logs:
