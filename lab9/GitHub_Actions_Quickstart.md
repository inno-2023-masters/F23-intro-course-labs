## Task 1: Create your First GitHub Actions Pipeline

Steps to create a basic workflow from github actions quick start guide
- Create a ```.github/workflows``` folder in the root folder of the repo.
- then create a yaml file ```github-actions-demo.yml``` in that folder.
- paste the following demo in that .yml file,
```yml
    name: GitHub Actions Demo
    run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
    on: [push]
    jobs:
    Explore-GitHub-Actions:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
        - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
        - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
        - name: Check out repository code
            uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
        - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
        - name: List files in the repository
            run: |
            ls ${{ github.workspace }}
        - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

- Now you will see that the workflow is triggered as soon as we push it to our repo

## Task 2: Gathering System Information and Manual Triggering

Steps to create a basic workflow for ```manual triggering``` and to ```gather system info```

1. **Manual triggering**

- create a new yaml file in the ```.github/workflows``` folder called ```github-manual-actions.yml```
- now paste the following stuff in that file
```yml
name: GitHub Manual Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Manual Actions üöÄ
on: 
    push:
    workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was manualy triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

2. **Gather system info**

- finally just add the following few lines in the ```github-manual-actions.yml``` as follows to gather system info
```yml
      - name: Gather system information
        run: |
          echo "Runner info:"
          uname -a
          echo "Hardware info:"
          lscpu
          echo "Operating system details:"
          cat /etc/os-release
```

The system information is as follows:

```shell
0s
Run echo "Runner info:"
