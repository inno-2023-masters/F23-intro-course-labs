### Gathering system information
This code may be intergrated with any other workflow file to gather system information:
```
on: [push]
jobs:
  collect-info:
    runs-on: ${{ runner.os }}
    steps:
      - name: Collect hardware and OS details
        run: |
          echo "ðŸ–¥ Runner hardware specifications:"
          lscpu
          echo "ðŸ“Š Memory usage:"
          free -m
          echo "ðŸ’» Operating system details:"
          uname -a
```
The steps to configure such a file is the same as above.
