# CI/CD Lab - GitHub Actions

In this lab, you will explore continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices using GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions provides a powerful workflow automation tool to streamline your development and deployment processes. You will perform various tasks related to setting up CI/CD pipelines and gathering system information using GitHub Actions. Follow the tasks below to complete the lab assignment.

## Task 1: Create your First GitHub Actions Pipeline

**To achieve a grade of 6/10**, follow these steps:

1. Read the Official Guide:
   - Follow the official GitHub Actions [quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart).
   - Document all your observations, key concepts, and steps you followed in a Markdown file named "GitHub_Actions_Quickstart.md" in the lab folder.

2. Observe the Workflow Execution:
   - Push some changes to your repository and observe the GitHub Actions workflow execution.
   - Document the output, any errors encountered, and any observations in the same "GitHub_Actions_Quickstart.md" file.

## Task 2: Gathering System Information and Manual Triggering

To earn an additional 4 points, follow these steps for system information gathering and manual triggering:

1. Configure a Manual Trigger:
   - Extend your existing GitHub Actions workflow to include a [manual trigger](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#defining-inputs-for-manually-triggered-workflows).
   - We don't need inputs for manually triggered workflows you can skip them.
   - Document the changes made to the workflow file in the same "GitHub_Actions_Quickstart.md" file.
   - Check the guide on how to manually run the workflow using the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow) if you face any issue.

2. Gather System Information:
   - Modify your workflow to include an additional step for gathering system information.
   - Use the appropriate actions and steps to collect information about the runner, hardware specifications, and operating system details.
   - Document the changes made to the workflow file and the gathered system information in the same "GitHub_Actions_Quickstart.md" file.

### Guidelines

- Use proper Markdown formatting and structure for the documentation files.
- Organize the files within the lab folder using appropriate naming conventions.
- Create a Pull Request to the main branch of the repository with your completed lab assignment.

> Note: Actively explore GitHub Actions and CI/CD practices to enhance your development and deployment workflows. Use the official guide and documentation as a starting point and document your observations along the way.
